' Part 1 
' Implement missing sections of the Car class.
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
class Car(object):
    '''Write the constructor. It should take in four arguments:
       - make (a string, the company name, a.k.a. brand)
       - model (a string)
       - mpg (miles per gallon, a float)
       - tank_capacity (capacity of the gas tank in gallons, a float)
       These should all be assigned to corresponding private fields, i.e., with
       names that start with '__'.  Use the names in the 'str' method provided below.
       '''

    '''Write getters for make, model, mpg, and tank_capacity.'''

    '''Write setters for mpg and tank_capacity.'''

    '''Write a method called get_total_range.
       It returns the total distance the car can travel on a full tank of
       gas.'''

    Do not do any math here except a single +. To get credit, you must call
    the methods you have already written.
